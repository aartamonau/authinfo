* What is authinfo?

  Authinfo is supposed to be a "keep it simple stupid" and "don't reinvent the
  wheel" password manager. It's simple in that the passwords are stored in a
  human readable text file. Actually, it doesn't even support updating that
  file. It doesn't reinvent the wheel because it reuses the file format that
  has been there for decades, namely [[http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl5_netrc.htm][netrc]] with extensions introduced by
  [[http://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]]. Similarly to Gnus, authinfo can read files that are encrypted with
  [[http://www.gnupg.org/][GnuPG]]. Since authinfo cannot update password file on its own, it's should be
  used in conjunction with your favorite text editor. It's especially
  convenient if your editor can also seamlessly decrypt GnuPG files (like
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] does).
